            <h2>My Interests in Technology & Coding</h2>
            <p>I’ve been interested in technology for as long as I can remember, being fortunate enough to have lived in a household with tech-savvy parents who knew their way around equipment of the time. Growing up with computers, games consoles, and the like available at pretty much every phase of my life means they’ve become pretty integrated into my personal and professional life. </p>
            <p>Until recently, coding has always been more of a background presence that I’ve been aware of and occasionally interacted with but never really actually understood. This changed when I had to start using MATLAB during my engineering course, which meant actually having to understand what I was writing as opposed to the copy and pasting you can normally get away with casually. This turned out to be one of the more satisfying and engaging part of the course, and has directly led to my more serious interest in the subject.</p>

            <h2>Why I am interested in CodeNation</h2>
            <p>I was first referred to CodeNation by a tutor of mine at an organisation called Newleaf, a group that helps people develop their skills and find employment that I joined after finishing university, which didn’t quite make me as employable as I would have hoped.</p>
            <p>The possibility of taking a coding course really appealed to me, since it’s the sort of thing I’ve always felt like I should learn, but never actually put serious time in to do so. Additionally, the ‘Boot Camp’ style of learning is one I find very useful since it more or less forces me to learn the subject matter, as opposed to more self directed learning where I find it easy to drift away and lose focus.</p>
