            <h2>Legal Guidelines/Constraints Affecting Digital Projects (Specifically, Websites)</h2>
            <p>One of the most impactful laws affecting digital products is that of the relatively recently introduced GDPR; the General Data Protection Regulation, the aim of which is to ensure the protection of personal data belonging to people from the European Union (And the associated Economic Area). Compliance with these laws is of the utmost importance to any organisation which intends to process the personal information of people in some way, for both ethical reasons and financial reasons since the fines involves for violations can be high, scaling to match a proportion of the relevant organisations worldwide annual turnover.</p>
            <p>To briefly overview what this law entails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consent: Organisations processing personal data must have the informed consent of the people who that data is about, meaning they must get permission in an easily understandable, distinguishable, and accessible form. Additionally, it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.</li>
                <li>Privacy by Design: Systems should be built from the ground up with protection of data as a core feature, rather than having it added in after the fact, and data processed should be minimised to only that which is necessary to complete the task in question, reducing the impact of breaches.</li>
                <li>Breach Notification: Organisations which suffer a data breach must notify the appropriate regulatory body within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.</li>
                <li>Right to Access & Data Portability: The ‘data controller’ (IE: The person the data is about) has the right to be provided with a copy of the data about them in electronic, commonly used, machine readable format, on request, and furthermore have the right to transmit that data to other ‘data controllers’ (people) if they wish.</li>
                <li>Right to be Forgotten: This clause prevents an organisation from holding in to unnecessary data, and data which the permission to use has been withdrawn, demanding that once the data is no longer relevant for the original purposes, it must be erased.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>For more information on the subject you can go to <a href="https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation">this link</a> which summarises it in a more succinct and clear form than I really could.</p>
            <p>Another set of laws which can affect digital products is that related to copyright of protected data. These are much less clear in many ways than GDPR, but the general idea is that an organisation cannot make use of the protected work of others (For most purposes) without clear permission that they are allowed to do so. Copyright is an inherent right granted to the creator of a work, and no process is needed to register protection.</p>
            <p>For example, if you created a website that simply used many images you found on google images it is likely to be a breach of copyright, since many of the creators of those images will not have given you permission to use their work for yourself (Though it is possible that some have given open permission for anybody to do so).</p>
            <p>While websites may be one of the more likely places for a breach of copyright to occur, they are by no means the only. Things like using protected music for a video, protected models/texture in a game, or protected images in an advertisement can all constitute breaches of copyright.</p>
            <p>A law that does affect specifically websites, however, is that relating to the use of Cookies. Cookies are simply a text file stored on your device by a website, that contains information. What that information is can vary, but most of the time it is used for identification and advertising purposes, remembering things like items you have put in the websites shopping basket for the next time you return, or keeping you logged in to a certain place, but they can also be used for tracking what you look at and what you do for advertising purposes, even across other website that happen to use the same, or compatible, software.</p>
            <p>The relevant EU directive (2009/136/EC, for reference) essentially demands that a website must get permission from visitors before putting cookies on their device, in a clear, informed manner, similar to that required by GDPR. However, many websites simply turn away anybody who chooses to not allow cookies, meaning they must alter their browser settings if they wish to use that website.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility Issues Facing Websites</h2>
            <p>It’s important for a website to be accessible to as many people as possible. This includes things such as working on all types of device as well as ensuring it can be used by people with various disabilities such as those with impaired vision or hearing. It is often required by law that a website be accessible to those with disabilities.</p>
            <p>A few standard methods can be applied to ensure at least a basic level of accessibility. People with physical disabilities often use various technologies to mimic the keyboard usage, such as speech-to-text, and as such a website should be entirely navigable using keyboard alone, with no requirement for a mouse to be used. Similarly, people with impaired vision can use a piece of software that reads out what is present on the screen, so all images should have alternate text describing what they are, since screen readers will use this to describe a picture. Things like a transcript for any audio media can assist those with impaired hearing, while also allowing search engines to find the contents of the audio file, helping in multiple ways.</p>
            <p>There’s many small ways in which accessibility can be improved in addition to these, such as ensuring good contrast between text and background, making sure the zoom feature works without distorting the page and causing overlap, or and that a websites structure is clear and organised.</p>

            <h2>Appropriate Filetypes for Websites</h2>
            <p>While file sizes are less important than they once were due to advancements in technology, it’s still good practice for websites to minimize their network requirements, more for the benefit of limited data plans rather than loading speed concerns in the modern world.</p>
            <p>To this end, many of the file types used are designed with file size in mind. For example, the common image format .jpg can be extremely compressed, dramatically reducing the bandwidth used in uploading/downloading it. The actual structure and content of a website is most often determined by a .html file, which is essentially a text file containing tags that tell a browser what to display, and where. This can then be further modified with a .css file, which is what applies styling to a website, and actually makes the relatively bland HTML display look good.</p>
            <p>Images mostly take the form of things like the previously mentioned .jpg, along with .png & .gif, all of which have their own benefits and drawbacks such as variable transparency, ability to display animations, or effects of compression on their quality.</p>
            <p>If you download a large folder, it is likely to take the form of a .zip or a .rar file, signifying that it has been compressed to save space. If the thing you’re downloading is a document, it’s probably a .pdf, which has been designed to standardise document appearance/formatting across many different platforms (Unlike, say, a .doc, which can’t necessarily be used without microsoft word, and may appear differently even if it can be displayed.)</p>

            <p>The blog I am writing will be split into three pages, one of which will be an ‘About me’ page, containing a section written on my general interests in technology, and specifically coding, and two general content pages containing the following sections respectively:</p>
