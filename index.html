            <h2>The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
            <p>IT is used for a huge variety of tasks in modern business, but it mostly can be boiled down to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manipulation & storage of data. (For example, storing information in databases allowing for easy recall as required, manipulating numbers in quantities that would take a person years to calculate by hand.)</li>
                <li>Facilitation of communication. (Things such as email, slack, skype, enhancing local communication and enabling long distance communication.)</li>
                <li>Automation of tasks. (A huge range, from running industrial procedures without requiring more than cursory human attention, to database management similar to the first point, where new entries can be created and manipulated in response to input.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>The Methods, Skills, and Resources Needed to Succeed in a Digital Project</h2>
            <p>The precise nature of what exactly you will need to complete a digital project varies depending on the project in question, but a few things are applicable regardless. Primary among these are the ability to make and stick to a plan before you begin any serious work, with methods of checking your progress and verifying completed work. Things such as Trello, or a good word processor, can streamline this process, but what really matters is the skill of the people involved to set this up, rather than the specific program used. Some communication software will also prove helpful, anything from an email system, to more modern solutions such as Skype and Slack.</p>
            <p>Following this it will vary based on the task. For example, if you’re creating a website, a working knowledge of HTML & CSS will be necessary, as will (likely) some experience in graphic design, along with programs to make use of these (Such as Visual Studio Code and Photoshop.)</p>

             <h2>Risks That Impact Digital Projects</h2>
             <p>There’s a wide variety of risks that could affect a digital project. One of the most serious is that of data-loss, which if not mitigated can even lead to the cancelling of a project in bad cases. Modern software can mitigate this almost, if not completely, entirely, with such methods as backing data up in the cloud, keeping it safe from even the most catastrophic of personal device failures. Modern data loss is more likely to occur from network or signal errors, such as messages not being sent or documents uploaded incorrectly due to a loss of connection.</p>
             <p>However, this does lead onto a second risk that is often taken with a digital project: Security. If care is not taken to keep a system safe from intrusion, it is possible that information could be stolen or intercepted. This is mostly a risk to organisations handling things such as personal details, passwords, or other such databases of customer information, but that does not mean it is not a risk to other types of project, where private information (Such as the specifications of an unreleased product) could be leaked before ready for release.</p>
             <p>Software compatibility is another issue worth considering. It’s entirely possible that different members of a project will be using different software (Or different versions of the same software) to accomplish the same task, and that one may have compatibility issues with the other, creating sharing problems. Alternatively, software that functions perfectly well on one piece of hardware may have problems running on another, creating another source of problems. This can be mitigated with standardisation across a project team.</p>
             <p>Another risk is that of feature creep, and mismanagement. While not unique to digital projects, the nature of them often being performed remotely means that the effects can be harder to notice until it is too late to really stop. Over enthusiastic team members may promise more than they can realistically deliver, while others may be assigned to tasks that don’t make full use of their abilities, wasting development time. A carefully made plan grounded in reality can help solve these issues, but it will need to be implemented from the beginning and maintained, rather than set up and ignored.</p>

             <h2>How to Select IT Systems and Hardware</h2>
             <p>The IT systems & hardware you select will depend entirely on the project you are undertaking, and the requirements it has. The first step as with many things in a professional environment will be to consult a person skilled in the specific field you’re interested in for advice.</p>
             <p>Determining the software you need to perform the relevant tasks will help you decide on the hardware you need to support it. For example if the software required only runs on MacOS, you will need to invest in a Mac computer and appropriate accessories. On the other hand, if you’re intending to run a web server, depending on the scale you may need anything from a single computer to a whole server bank to run it, unless you plan to hire another organisation to host it for you.</p>

             <h2>How Chosen Technologies Helped Me Achieve My Outcomes</h2>
             <p>In this specific project, I will be using Trello to plan as I go. The ability to keep the tasks I have to do, and what has already been completed in order, to ensure that a schedule is stuck to has proven invaluable in the past, and I’m sure will do so again. Additionally, the labelling feature gives me a quick and easy way to see what part of the project is being worked on currently, and know what I will likely need to perform that task (Such as Design labelled tasks needing Visual Studio open.)</p>
             <p>Visual Studio Code is being used to make the website itself, and it is a substantial time saver. The autocomplete feature it possesses, doing things such as automatically adding the close tag to any opened HTML tags is incredibly convenient.</p>
             <p>Version control is being done through GitHub, mitigating the risk of data-loss through storage of previous versions, and assisting with organisation in the same manner (For example, if I push an update to Github, and make some mistakes after that, rather than needing to dig in my devices files for ‘HTMLIndexV3Final’ or some similarly named backup, I can simply use GitHub to retrieve the earlier version.</p>
