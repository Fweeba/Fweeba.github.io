            <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2>
            <p>I have no complaints to make about the software used to actually write the code required (Visual Studio Code), it did exactly what was needed of it and more, with the autocomplete feature in particular proving exceptionally useful.</p>
            <p>On that point, GitHub also works as expected, though the method of keeping it updated is somewhat arcane, and I needed to keep looking it up every time I pushed an update to it after not doing so for a few hours.</p>
            <p>While I can see the use Trello has for projects of substantial scope, or those completed by a group, in a solo project this narrow/short, it didn’t really save any more time or make work more efficient than it would have been without it as far as I can tell. This project was a very linear step to step process without much to forget or that could potentially fall by the wayside, and no coordination with others was required, making it not particularly useful.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
            <p>Again, Visual Studio Code was the highlight here, and is easily better than similar software I’ve used to write HTML in the past (Though admittedly it isn’t that hard to be better than Notepad or Notepad++)</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, Trello isn’t particularly useful in a task of this scale and complexity, taking more time to set up and maintain than it saves in productivity. I didn’t think GitHub was going to be particularly useful for this task either, until I had to work on the project from home for a day, during which having access to the repository became very useful. As such I would say that it was an appropriate tool to use.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
            <p>I believe that splitting up the content of the blog into multiple pages was a good idea, otherwise there’s a very real chance that the blog could have become one homogenous wall of text that would be very hard to fix with styling.</p>
            <p>On the subject, I am pleased with the aesthetics. Despite being relatively simple I like to think it has a sort of minimalistic style to it now, with the dark background contrasting the light text highlighting the words on the page, and the fixed navbar making transition from one page to the others simple.</p>
			<p>With regards to weaknesses, the same style I referred to just now does make it seem a bit dated, like it’s a website from the mid 2000’s. Additionally, the pages are too similar, looking almost identical with little to split them up aside from the content of the text, and despite being split up the wall of text problem hasn’t been solved completely, just reduced.</p>
        </div>
		<div>
            <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
            <p>When I was styling the website, I wanted to make the Navbar ‘sticky’, so when you scrolled down the page title would be left behind, just showing the linkbar and saving a small amount of screenspace, while fitting the websites style. Unfortunately when I was trying to figure out how to do this, it would have required introducing Javascript into the style and I simply didn’t have the time to figure out how everything worked for implementing this into the website.</p>
            <p>To help solve the wall of text problem, I was interested in the idea of splitting each section of text into a drop-down bar, where the user could click a section and it would expand downwards, showing the relevant text, and they could click on the title again to reduce it, similar to the FAQ section of some websites. If I had more time to work on the project, this is likely one of the avenues I would take next.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
            <p>For the actual content of the website, it would be hard to review it all without listing every section and typing the words ‘Yes it has been done’, so the fact that you can see all the content on the website may have to serve for that purpose.</p>
            <p>With regards to the website itself, it has all the necessary features (Links, different sections for different topics, at least one image of an appropriate file-type, appropriate styling) and a consistent style across the pages which highlights the information people may want to read by contrasting it with the background, and keeping the sections visually separated with the distinct headings. The pages are free from errors or bugs, can be zoomed in/out distortion until the extreme ends, and functions on different browsers or screen sizes.</p>

            <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
            <p>This section has been somewhat covered in the previous sections, but to restate, Visual Studio Code increases productivity substantially, with its automated management of Git updates and autocomplete features reducing the amount of typing that needs to be done to complete a task. While not hugely useful here, Trello would enhance the efficiency of a team of people working together by ensuring people know what they should be working on, and what has been completed, reducing overlap of work and saving time.</p>
            <p>GitHub has been helpful as a file repository, allowing me to work on this project from home and at CodeNation, enhancing productivity by making that process not only possible, but simple. Google Sheets has performed a similar role, and is what I’m using to write this content out at home right now, on the same document I was using at CodeNation.</p>

            <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
            <p>In terms of, say, software to use, I can’t see many methods on how to improve productivity or efficiency with other options, though that could simply be my inexperience showing.</p>
            <p>It’s probably not particularly helpful for me to say that I could improve productivity by simply working faster, but it’s not really incorrect either. As I continue to work on projects like this, my productivity will naturally increase, to a point, as I get more proficient at using the software in question. Things like using relevant hotkeys or shortcuts to save button presses/clicks will become more natural, and while they may not save much time individually, it will add up over time.</p>
			<p>About efficiency, working in a professional environment is a good way to keep that high. If you’re working from home, or in a more casual setting, it is often easy to get distracted or unfocused from the task at hand, which is time you’re not spending working on the project.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
            <p>If a project was to get much bigger than this it would become helpful to start working in a team. On small projects solo work is often more efficient due to not needing to spend time on distribution of work, but for anything sizeable the gained productivity of additional people far outweighs the loss of efficiency.</p>
            <p>The aforementioned usage of hotkeys/shortcuts is another method, saving a little bit of time that will eventually add up to a lot of time, though it takes a big project for it to be worth learning for.</p>
            <p>Potentially automation is a method of saving some time for a few specific tasks, at least. Things like pushing updates to GitHub or copying/pasting text for new sections into the HTML following the same format are tasks which don’t require much a computer couldn’t do, typically just moving things around without much human input required.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
            <p>There’s a couple methods to use to go about testing digital projects, that are relevant to us right now, at least. The first is to put your project into all the conditions it is expected to work, and observe what happens. For example, does your website function when zoomed in or zoomed out? Does it work on a mobile device? What about this different mobile device? And so on, until you have found any errors that occur in normal usage, so you can proceed to fix them. In this project, that means testing it in different browsers, Chrome and Safari, for now.</p>
            <p>The second method is called User Testing. Essentially, you show the website to people who will then see if they can navigate it, find what they want, if everything is legible and fit for their purposes. This is a good way to find out if the human elements of the website are in order, if buttons and links are where people expect them to be, or if the style looks decent.</p>
            <p>Typically both methods are employed together when testing any digital solution that has a human element. (IE: If it needs to be used by humans.)</p>
